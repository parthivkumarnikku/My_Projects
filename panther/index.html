          title="Sponge construction is a cryptographic primitive that uses a sponge function to absorb an input message into an internal state, which is then squeezed to produce an output. It involves a permutation function that shuffles the bits of the internal state to ensure security. The sponge construction is flexible and can be tailored to different security requirements by adjusting the parameters. It is widely used in modern cryptographic designs due to its simplicity,efficiency, and provable security properties.

These efficient and compact cryptographic algorithms are ideal for resource-constrained environments. By implementing lightweight primitives in networks,we can achieve enhanced security without compromising performance or resource usage."
